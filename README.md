## Background Context

The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !

<img src="./doc/image.png" height="100%" width="100%">

> The decision to undertake this project was driven by a desire to engage in a challenging endeavor that would allow me to utilize and showcase my proficiency in the C programming language. I sought an opportunity to put my C skills to the test by creating a tangible and meaningful output. By embarking on this project, I aimed to explore the boundaries of what I could achieve using C and challenge myself to develop a substantial application.

#### Compilation command

I have created a make file that compiles the source code and create one executable.

```
$ make maze
```

### Usage

After compiling using the make file just run:

```
$ ./bin/maze
```

or

```
$ cd bin
$./maze
```

To remove it run:

```
$ make clean
```
